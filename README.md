# Bevy Playground

Just a place to fool around with the Bevy game development framework.

## How to run

If you have Rust installed just checkout the code and do 

```bash
cargo run
```

It's that simple. :)

If you don't, you can read how to install it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
